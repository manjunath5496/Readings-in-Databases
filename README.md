<p>A&nbsp;<strong>database</strong>&nbsp;is an organized collection of&nbsp;<a title="Data (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">data</a>, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal&nbsp;<a href="#Design_and_modeling">design and modeling</a>&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="#Database_management_system">database management system</a>&nbsp;(DBMS) is the&nbsp;<a title="Software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>&nbsp;that interacts with&nbsp;<a title="End user" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user">end users</a>, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". Often the term "database" is also used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.</p>

<h2><span id="Terminology_and_overview" class="mw-headline">Terminology and overview</span></h2>
<p>Formally, a "database" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a "database management system" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows&nbsp;<a title="User (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)">users</a>&nbsp;to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.</p>
<p>Because of the close relationship between them, the term "database" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.</p>
<p>Outside the world of professional&nbsp;<a title="Information technology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology">information technology</a>, the term&nbsp;<em>database</em>&nbsp;is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a&nbsp;<a title="Spreadsheet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEUllmanWidom19971_1-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Existing DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data definition</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Update</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored in the database or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the database.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li><strong>Administration</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular&nbsp;<a title="Database model" href="_model">database model</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETsitchizrisLochovsky1982_5-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;"Database system" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBeynon-Davies2003_6-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Physically, database&nbsp;<a title="Server (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>&nbsp;are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Multiprocessor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor">multiprocessor</a>&nbsp;computers, with generous memory and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Redundant array of independent disks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks">RAID</a>&nbsp;disk arrays used for stable storage. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most&nbsp;<a title="Database application" href="_application">database applications</a>. DBMSs may be built around a custom&nbsp;<a title="Computer multitasking" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">multitasking</a>&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Kernel (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computing)">kernel</a>&nbsp;with built-in&nbsp;<a title="Computer network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>&nbsp;support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard&nbsp;<a title="Operating system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>&nbsp;to provide these functions.</p>
<p>Since DBMSs comprise a significant&nbsp;<a title="Market (economics)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)">market</a>, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENelsonNelson2001_7-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Databases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the&nbsp;<a title="Query language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">query language</a>(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or&nbsp;<a title="XQuery" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuery">XQuery</a>), and their internal engineering, which affects performance,&nbsp;<a title="Scalability" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability">scalability</a>, resilience, and security.</p>
<h2><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of&nbsp;<a title="Central processing unit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">processors</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Computer memory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">computer memory</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Computer data storage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">computer storage</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Computer network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a>. The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid 1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure:&nbsp;<a title="Navigational database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigational_database">navigational</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBachman1973_8-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;SQL/<a title="Relational database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational</a>, and post-relational.</p>
<p>The two main early navigational data models were the&nbsp;<a title="Hierarchical database model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model">hierarchical model</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="CODASYL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODASYL">CODASYL</a>&nbsp;model (<a title="Network model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model">network model</a>). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) to follow relationships from one record to another.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Relational model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">relational model</a>, first proposed in 1970 by&nbsp;<a title="Edgar F. Codd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar F. Codd</a>, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale&nbsp;<a title="Data processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing">data processing</a>&nbsp;applications, and as of 2018&nbsp;they remain dominant:&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="IBM DB2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DB2">IBM DB2</a>,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Oracle database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_database">Oracle</a>,&nbsp;<a title="MySQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Microsoft SQL Server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">Microsoft SQL Server</a>&nbsp;are the most searched&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="DBMS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBMS">DBMS</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.</p>
<p><a title="Object database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database">Object databases</a>&nbsp;were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of&nbsp;<a title="Object-relational impedance mismatch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">object-relational impedance mismatch</a>, which led to the coining of the term "post-relational" and also the development of hybrid&nbsp;<a title="Object-relational database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database">object-relational databases</a>.</p>
<p>The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as&nbsp;<a title="NoSQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>&nbsp;databases, introducing fast&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Key-value store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_store">key-value stores</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Document-oriented database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">document-oriented databases</a>. A competing "next generation" known as&nbsp;<a title="NewSQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSQL">NewSQL</a>&nbsp;databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.</p>

<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The introduction of the term&nbsp;<em>database</em>&nbsp;coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily&nbsp;<a title="Batch processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing">batch processing</a>. The&nbsp;<a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>&nbsp;cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term "data-base" in a specific technical sense.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>As computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and&nbsp;<a title="Charles Bachman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bachman">Charles Bachman</a>, author of one such product, the&nbsp;<a title="Integrated Data Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Data_Store">Integrated Data Store</a>&nbsp;(IDS), founded the Database Task Group within&nbsp;<a title="CODASYL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODASYL">CODASYL</a>, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of&nbsp;<a title="COBOL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the&nbsp;<em>CODASYL approach</em>, and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.</p>
<p>The CODASYL approach offered applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented by&nbsp;<a title="Hash function" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hashing</a>)</li>
<li>Navigating relationships (called&nbsp;<em>sets</em>) from one record to another</li>
<li>Scanning all the records in a sequential order</li>
</ol>
<p>Later systems added&nbsp;<a title="B-tree" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-trees</a>&nbsp;to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end users (as distinct from the navigational API). However CODASYL databases were complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.</p>
<p><a class="mw-redirect" title="International Business Machines" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Machines">IBM</a>&nbsp;also had their own DBMS in 1966, known as&nbsp;<a title="IBM Information Management System" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Information_Management_System">Information Management System</a>&nbsp;(IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the&nbsp;<a title="Apollo program" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program">Apollo program</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="System/360" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/360">System/360</a>. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed: the term was popularized by Bachman's 1973&nbsp;<a title="Turing Award" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing Award</a>&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;<em>The Programmer as Navigator</em>. IMS is classified by IBM as a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Hierarchical database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database">hierarchical database</a>.

<h3><span id="1970s.2C_relational_DBMS"></span><span id="1970s,_relational_DBMS" class="mw-headline">1970s, relational DBMS</span></h3>
<p><a title="Edgar F. Codd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar F. Codd</a>&nbsp;worked at IBM in&nbsp;<a title="San Jose, California" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California">San Jose, California</a>, in one of their offshoot offices that was primarily involved in the development of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Hard disk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk">hard disk</a>&nbsp;systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a "search" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking&nbsp;<em>A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</em>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECodd1970_12-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of&nbsp;<a title="Linked list" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a>&nbsp;of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to organise the data as a number of "<a title="Table (database)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)">tables</a>", each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a&nbsp;<a title="Primary key" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a>&nbsp;by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of&nbsp;<a title="Relational calculus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_calculus">relational calculus</a>&nbsp;(from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or&nbsp;<em>relations</em>) aimed to ensure that each "fact" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called&nbsp;<em>views</em>&nbsp;could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.</p>
<p>Codd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than tables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early implementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to depart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based.</p>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to represent cross-table relationships, rather than disk addresses, had two primary motivations. From an engineering perspective, it enabled tables to be relocated and resized without expensive database reorganization. But Codd was more interested in the difference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean mathematical definitions, and it also enabled query operations to be defined in terms of the established discipline of first-order predicate calculus; because these operations have clean mathematical properties, it becomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct ways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is no loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic or network models, though the connections between tables are no longer so explicit.</p>
<p>In the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal structure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a "repeating group" within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to such internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical keys.</p>
<p>For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single variable-length record. In the relational approach, the data would be&nbsp;<em>normalized</em>&nbsp;into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.</p>
<p>As well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd changed the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than requiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would use a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access path by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the responsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in terms of mathematical logic.</p>
<p>Codd's paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and&nbsp;<a title="Michael Stonebraker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Michael Stonebraker</a>. They started a project known as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="INGRES" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INGRES">INGRES</a>&nbsp;using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to&nbsp;<a title="IBM System R" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_R">System R</a>&nbsp;in a number of ways, including the use of a "language" for&nbsp;<a title="Data access" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access">data access</a>, known as&nbsp;<a title="QUEL query languages" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUEL_query_languages">QUEL</a>. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.</p>
<p>IBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="PRTV" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRTV">PRTV</a>, and a production one,&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Business System 12" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_System_12">Business System 12</a>, both now discontinued.&nbsp;<a title="Honeywell" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell">Honeywell</a>&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;<a title="Multics Relational Data Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics_Relational_Data_Store">MRDS</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="Multics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">Multics</a>, and now there are two new implementations:&nbsp;<a title="Dataphor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataphor">Alphora Dataphor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Rel (DBMS)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rel_(DBMS)">Rel</a>. Most other DBMS implementations usually called&nbsp;<em>relational</em>&nbsp;are actually SQL DBMSs.</p>

<h3><span id="Integrated_approach" class="mw-headline">Integrated approach</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable"><a title="Database machine" href="_machine">Database machine</a></div>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at lower cost. Examples were IBM&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="System/38" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/38">System/38</a>, the early offering of&nbsp;<a title="Teradata" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teradata">Teradata</a>, and the&nbsp;<a title="Britton Lee, Inc." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britton_Lee,_Inc.">Britton Lee, Inc.</a>&nbsp;database machine.</p>
<p>Another approach to hardware support for database management was&nbsp;<a title="International Computers Limited" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited">ICL</a>'s&nbsp;<a title="Content Addressable File Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Addressable_File_Store">CAFS</a>&nbsp;accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like&nbsp;<a title="Netezza" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netezza">Netezza</a>&nbsp;and Oracle (<a class="mw-redirect" title="Exadata" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exadata">Exadata</a>).</p>

<p>IBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd's concepts as&nbsp;<em><a title="IBM System R" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_R">System R</a></em>&nbsp;in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large "chunk". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized&nbsp;<a title="Query language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language">query language</a>&nbsp;&ndash; SQL &nbsp;&ndash; had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as&nbsp;<em>SQL/DS</em>, and, later,&nbsp;<em>Database 2</em>&nbsp;(<a title="IBM Db2 Family" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Db2_Family">DB2</a>).</p>

Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it wasn't until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Stonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as&nbsp;<a title="PostgreSQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary&nbsp;<a title="Data store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_store">data store</a>, as do many large companies and financial institutions).</p>
<p>In Sweden, Codd's paper was also read and&nbsp;<a title="Mimer SQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimer_SQL">Mimer SQL</a>&nbsp;was developed from the mid-1970s at&nbsp;<a title="Uppsala University" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_University">Uppsala University</a>.

<p>Another data model, the&nbsp;<a title="Entity&ndash;relationship model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">entity&ndash;relationship model</a>, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for&nbsp;<a title="Database design" href="_design">database design</a>&nbsp;as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model.

<p>The 1990s, along with a rise in&nbsp;<a title="Object-oriented programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a>, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as&nbsp;<a title="Object (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)">objects</a>. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their&nbsp;<a title="Property (programming)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming)">attributes</a>&nbsp;and not to individual fields.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;The term "<a title="Object-relational impedance mismatch" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">object-relational impedance mismatch</a>" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables.&nbsp;<a title="Object database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database">Object databases</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Object-relational database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database">object-relational databases</a>&nbsp;attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL.

<p><a class="mw-redirect" title="XML databases" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_databases">XML databases</a>&nbsp;are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on&nbsp;<a title="XML" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>&nbsp;document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records.</p>
<p><a title="NoSQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>&nbsp;databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing&nbsp;<a title="Denormalization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization">denormalized</a>&nbsp;data, and are designed to&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Horizontal scaling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_scaling">scale horizontally</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the&nbsp;<a title="CAP theorem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a>&nbsp;it is impossible for a&nbsp;<a title="Distributed computing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed system</a>&nbsp;to simultaneously provide&nbsp;<a title="Consistency model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">consistency</a>, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees.

For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called&nbsp;<a title="Eventual consistency" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a>&nbsp;to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.</p>
<p><a title="NewSQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSQL">NewSQL</a>&nbsp;is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="ACID (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)">ACID</a>&nbsp;guarantees of a traditional database system.</p>
<h2><span id="Use_cases" class="mw-headline">Use cases</span></h2>
<p>Databases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see&nbsp;<a title="Enterprise software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software">Enterprise software</a>).</p>
<p>Databases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering data or economic models.

<h2><span id="Classification" class="mw-headline">Classification</span></h2>
<p>One way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example:&nbsp;<a title="Bibliographic database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_database">bibliographic</a>, document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.</p>
<ul>
<li>An&nbsp;<a title="In-memory database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database">in-memory database</a>&nbsp;is a database that primarily resides in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Main memory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory">main memory</a>, but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment.</li>
<li>An&nbsp;<a title="Active database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_database">active database</a>&nbsp;includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of&nbsp;<a title="Database trigger" href="_trigger">database triggers</a>.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Cloud database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database">cloud database</a>&nbsp;relies on&nbsp;<a title="Cloud computing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud technology</a>. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, "in the cloud", while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a&nbsp;<a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Open API" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_API">Open APIs</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Data warehouse" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">Data warehouses</a>&nbsp;archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use&nbsp;<a title="Universal Product Code" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code">UPCs</a>&nbsp;so that they can be compared with&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="ACNielsen" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACNielsen">ACNielsen</a>&nbsp;data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and&nbsp;<a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">mining</a>&nbsp;data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Deductive database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_database">deductive database</a>&nbsp;combines&nbsp;<a title="Logic programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a>&nbsp;with a relational database.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Distributed database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database">distributed database</a>&nbsp;is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Document-oriented database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database">document-oriented database</a>&nbsp;is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.</li>
<li>An&nbsp;<a title="Embedded database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database">embedded database</a>&nbsp;system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application's end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li>End-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases. Some of them are much simpler than full-fledged DBMSs, with more elementary DBMS functionality.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Federated database system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_database_system">federated database system</a>&nbsp;comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a&nbsp;<a title="Heterogeneous database system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_database_system">heterogeneous database system</a>), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.</li>
<li>Sometimes the term&nbsp;<em>multi-database</em>&nbsp;is used as a synonym to federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically&nbsp;<a title="Middleware (distributed applications)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware_(distributed_applications)">middleware</a>&nbsp;is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the&nbsp;<a title="Two-phase commit protocol" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit protocol</a>, to allow&nbsp;<a title="Distributed transaction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_transaction">distributed (global) transactions</a>&nbsp;across the participating databases.</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a title="Graph database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a>&nbsp;is a kind of NoSQL database that uses&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Graph (data structure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)">graph structures</a>&nbsp;with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as&nbsp;<a title="Triplestore" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestores</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Network database model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_database_model">network databases</a>.</li>
<li>An&nbsp;<a title="Array DBMS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS">array DBMS</a>&nbsp;is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional&nbsp;<a title="Array data structure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">arrays</a>&nbsp;such as satellite images and climate simulation output.</li>
<li>In a&nbsp;<a title="Hypertext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="Hypermedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">hypermedia</a>&nbsp;database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be&nbsp;<a title="Hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinked</a>&nbsp;to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing&nbsp;<a title="Online encyclopedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_encyclopedia">online encyclopedias</a>, where users can conveniently jump around the text. The&nbsp;<a title="World Wide Web" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>&nbsp;is thus a large distributed hypertext database.</li>

<p>It is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEConnollyBegg2014102_26-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the&nbsp;<a title="Database engine" href="_engine">database engine</a>.</p>
<p>Often DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use. The trend is to minimise the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as&nbsp;<a title="Embedded database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_database">embedded databases</a>&nbsp;the need to target zero-administration is paramount.</p>
<p>The large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and can have involved thousands of human years of development effort through their lifetime.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[a]</a></sup></p>
<p>Early multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via&nbsp;<a title="Computer terminal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal">terminals</a>&nbsp;or terminal emulation software. The&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Client&ndash;server architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_architecture">client&ndash;server architecture</a>&nbsp;was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a&nbsp;<a title="Multitier architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture">multitier architecture</a>&nbsp;incorporating&nbsp;<a title="Application server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server">application servers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Web server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a>&nbsp;with the end user interface via a&nbsp;<a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>&nbsp;with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEConnollyBegg2014106&ndash;113_28-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>A general-purpose DBMS will provide public&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Application programming interface" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">application programming interfaces</a>&nbsp;(API) and optionally a processor for&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Database language" href="_language">database languages</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a title="SQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>&nbsp;to allow applications to be written to interact with the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customised and linked to a single application. For example, an&nbsp;<a title="Email" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">email</a>&nbsp;system performing many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.</p>
<h3><span id="Application" class="mw-headline">Application</span></h3>
<p>External interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEConnollyBegg201465_29-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;This can range from a&nbsp;<a title="Comparison of database tools" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_database_tools">database tool</a>&nbsp;that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a web site that happens to use a database to store and search information.</p>

<h3><span id="Database_languages" class="mw-headline">Database languages</span></h3>
<p>Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as&nbsp;<a title="Sublanguage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublanguage">sublanguages</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Data control language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language">Data control language</a>&nbsp;(DCL) &ndash; controls access to data;</li>
<li><a title="Data definition language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language">Data definition language</a>&nbsp;(DDL) &ndash; defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;</li>

<li><a title="Data query language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_query_language">Data query language</a>&nbsp;(DQL) &ndash; allows searching for information and computing derived information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from&nbsp;<a title="Codd's 12 rules" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd%27s_12_rules">the relational model as described by Codd</a>&nbsp;(for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the&nbsp;<a title="American National Standards Institute" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute">American National Standards Institute</a>&nbsp;(ANSI) in 1986, and of the&nbsp;<a title="International Organization for Standardization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a>&nbsp;(ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and is supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChapple2005_30-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IBM-sql_31-0" class="reference"></sup></li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" title="OQL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OQL">OQL</a>&nbsp;is an object model language standard (from the&nbsp;<a title="Object Data Management Group" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Data_Management_Group">Object Data Management Group</a>).

<p>A database language may also incorporate features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management</li>
<li>Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing</li>
<li>Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)</li>

<h2><span id="Storage" class="mw-headline">Storage</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable"><a title="Computer data storage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">Computer data storage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Database engine" href="_engine">Database engine</a></div>
<p>Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the&nbsp;<em>internal</em>&nbsp;(physical)&nbsp;<em>level</em>&nbsp;in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g.,&nbsp;<a title="Metadata" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>, "data about the data", and internal&nbsp;<a title="Data structure" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structures</a>) to reconstruct the&nbsp;<em>conceptual level</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>external level</em>&nbsp;from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the&nbsp;<a title="Database engine" href="_engine">database engine</a>&nbsp;a.k.a. "storage engine". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems'&nbsp;<a title="File system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file systems</a>&nbsp;as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).</p>
<p>Some DBMSs support specifying which&nbsp;<a title="Character encoding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>&nbsp;was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.</p>
<p>Various low-level&nbsp;<a title="Database storage structures" href="_storage_structures">database storage structures</a>&nbsp;are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also&nbsp;<a title="Column-oriented DBMS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS">column-oriented</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Correlation database" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_database">correlation databases</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Materialized_views" class="mw-headline">Materialized views</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable"><a title="Materialized view" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view">Materialized view</a></div>
<p>Often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing&nbsp;<em>materialized views</em>, which consist of frequently needed&nbsp;<em>external views</em>&nbsp;or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing of them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.</p>
<h3><span id="Replication" class="mw-headline">Replication</span></h3>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Database replication" href="_replication">Database replication</a></div>
<p>Occasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to a same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.</p>
<h2><span id="Security" class="mw-headline">Security</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable"><a title="Database security" href="_security">Database security</a></div>
<p><a title="Database security" href="_security">Database security</a>&nbsp;deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).</p>
<p>Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) is allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.</p>
<p>This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Privilege (Computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(Computing)">privileges</a>&nbsp;to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called "subschemas". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.</p>
<p><a title="Data security" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security">Data security</a>&nbsp;in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see&nbsp;<a title="Physical security" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_security">physical security</a>), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Data encryption" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_encryption">data encryption</a>).</p>
<p>Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic&nbsp;<a title="Database audit" href="_audit">database audit</a>&nbsp;later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this to the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches.</p>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable"><a title="Data migration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_migration#Database_migration">Data migration &sect;&nbsp;Database migration</a></div>
<p>A database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different&nbsp;<a title="Total cost of ownership" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership">total costs of ownership</a>&nbsp;or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs.</p>

<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;<a title="Database tuning" href="_tuning">Database tuning</a></div>
<p>After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed&nbsp;<a title="User interface" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interfaces</a>&nbsp;to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).</p>
<p>When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.</p>
<p>After the database is created, initialised and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (<a title="Database tuning" href="_tuning">tuning</a>) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc.</p>
<h2><span id="Backup_and_restore" class="mw-headline">Backup and restore</span></h2>
<div class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">&nbsp;<a title="Backup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup">Backup</a></div>
<p>Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.</p>
<h2><span id="Static_analysis" class="mw-headline">Static analysis</span></h2>
<p>Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *<a title="Abstract interpretation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation">Abstract interpretation</a>&nbsp;framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHalderCortesi2011_33-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data.

<div class="thumbcaption">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first task of a database designer is to produce a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Conceptual data model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_data_model">conceptual data model</a>&nbsp;that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Entity-relationship model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-relationship_model">entity-relationship model</a>, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the&nbsp;<a title="Unified Modeling Language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modeling Language</a>. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like "can a customer also be a supplier?", or "if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?", or "if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.</p>
<p>Producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from&nbsp;<a title="Business process modeling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_modeling">business processes</a>, or the analysis of&nbsp;<a title="Workflow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">workflow</a>&nbsp;in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.</p>
<p>Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a&nbsp;<a title="Database schema" href="_schema">schema</a>&nbsp;that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Logical data model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_data_model">logical data model</a>&nbsp;expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms&nbsp;<em>data model</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>database model</em>&nbsp;are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use&nbsp;<em>data model</em>&nbsp;for the design of a specific database, and&nbsp;<em>database model</em>&nbsp;for the modeling notation used to express that design).</p>
<p>The most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as&nbsp;<a title="Database normalization" href="_normalization">normalization</a>. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary "fact" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.</p>
<p>The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called&nbsp;<em>physical database design</em>, and the output is the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Physical data model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_data_model">physical data model</a>. A key goal during this stage is&nbsp;<a title="Data independence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_independence">data independence</a>, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.</p>
<p>Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining&nbsp;<a title="Access control" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control">access control</a>&nbsp;to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.</p>

<h3><span id="External.2C_conceptual.2C_and_internal_views"></span><span id="External,_conceptual,_and_internal_views" class="mw-headline">External, conceptual, and internal views</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A database management system provides three views of the database data:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>external level</strong>&nbsp;defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>conceptual level</strong>&nbsp;unifies the various external views into a compatible global view.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDate200331&ndash;32_36-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>internal level</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<em>physical level</em>) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Index (database)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(database)">indexes</a>&nbsp;to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views (<a title="Materialized view" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view">materialized views</a>), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is typically only one conceptual (or logical) and physical (or internal) view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are the interest of the&nbsp;<a title="Human resources" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources">human resources</a>&nbsp;department. Thus different departments need different&nbsp;<em>views</em>&nbsp;of the company's database.</p>
<p>The three-level database architecture relates to the concept of&nbsp;<em>data independence</em>&nbsp;which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.</p>
<p>The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.</p>
<p>Separating the&nbsp;<em>external</em>,&nbsp;<em>conceptual</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>internal</em>&nbsp;levels was a major feature of the relational database model implementations that dominate 21st century databases.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDate200331&ndash;32_36-1" class="reference"></sup></p>
<h2><span id="Research" class="mw-headline">Research</span></h2>
<p>Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Academia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia">academia</a>&nbsp;and in the research and development groups of companies (for example&nbsp;<a title="IBM Research" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Research">IBM Research</a>). Research activity includes&nbsp;<a title="Database theory" href="_theory">theory</a>&nbsp;and development of&nbsp;<a title="Prototype" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype">prototypes</a>. Notable research topics have included&nbsp;<a title="Data model" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model">models</a>, the atomic transaction concept, and related&nbsp;<a title="Concurrency control" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control">concurrency control</a>&nbsp;techniques, query languages and&nbsp;<a title="Query optimization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_optimization">query optimization</a>&nbsp;methods,&nbsp;<a title="RAID" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a>, and more.</p>
